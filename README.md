  ## Description 
  We are a non-profit who believe that hunger is not a food issue, it is a logistics issue. We seek to break the barriers to food donations; bridging the gap between food establishments with surplus food and those in need.

  The Our Same Kitchen App is a web and mobile application allowing food establishments (e.g. restaurants, grocery stores, farms) to easily add and notify our team of surplus food, and when and where to pick it up. The application uses HTML, CSS, Javascript/ES6, Nodejs, Express-Handlebars, Passport, and Sequelize.
